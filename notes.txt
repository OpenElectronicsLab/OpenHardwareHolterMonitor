esp32	20mA

ADP7158	4mA -- just one of many low noise linear regulator
sdCard	<1mA

not tx	~100-200mA
w/ tx	~500mA ... thus efficient power isolation to run off of USB

2 main batteries, but can operate from one, and can swap each out one at a time
 ... simple power-level indicator? push-button and light up to 0-to-3 LEDs?
 ... also indicate on web-page?
1 (regargeable?) coin battery for the real-time-clock
  TODO: look up coin charger schematic on Adafruit?

Look up: LP5912-3.0DRVR LDO Voltage Regulator

18650 batteries are widely available and cost is reasonable
